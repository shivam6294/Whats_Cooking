# [What's Cooking](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking) Kaggle Competition
* This was my attempt at the What's Cooking Kaggle Competition, also my first ever kaggle competition attempt. 
* The aim at the time was to get familiar with various ML classifiers and their parameters.

The entire solution is containted in:
<b>Whats_Cooking.ipynb</b>

The competition is a multi-class classification competition with a lot of(19)  classes. The training data consists of a bag of  ingredients and the target variable is the cuisine. It's a great competition to try out various multi-class classifiers.
